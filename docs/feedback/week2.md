#### Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: There was both a chair and a minute taker assigned for the meeting and the 2 roles were pretty clear from how the meeting proceeded. Don't forget that EVERY student needs to be in each role at least ONCE during this course, so plan your weekly meetings with that in mind for the following weeks. 

#### Agenda 

Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository in time for the meeting (enough time before so that I can take a look over it). It did follow the template from Brightspace and not the one from the old GitHub repository. However, even though the meeting went pretty smoothly, not every talking point from the agenda was clear enough from just reading it. 
Let me try to summarize the main point of feedback that I have for you. Given that we assume you have no experience with teamwork in software engineering and with the organization that goes behind it, this agenda was pretty good! It followed the template given to you, it had the necessary info for me the TA in the header, it showed some attempts at proper time estimation, and so on. Thus, the resulting meeting had the right interaction between you and me. However, once you start working together more, have more meetings between yourselves, familiarize yourselves with each other, and so on, I also want to see the agenda transform and become more efficient. What do I mean? Not every step from the template agenda needs to necessarily happen as it is written, as long as the meeting will have TA interaction and room for discussion/questions/feedback, feel free to experiment. 

Let's look at some of the points from the agenda. For example: "Approval of the agenda - Does anyone have any additions? (5 min)", in my opinion, the agenda should be approved before the meeting, sent on your channel of communication, and ask for suggestions and feedback the day/night before the meeting. "Announcements by the TA (5 min)" I assume here is also the part where I answer any questions that you might have for me (and which you send me before the meeting). "Talking Points: (Inform/ brainstorm/ decision-making/ discuss)" <- what does this mean? "Discuss the project features and divide responsibilities" <- I think I was still present for this part, did you manage to successfully finish this issue? It seemed a bit too optimistic to already divide the responsibilities without ever touching any kind of coding yet :) LATER EDIT: Please be careful with the formatting, markdown allows nested bullet-point lists so please make use of that, I only later realized that the discussion on the Code of Conduct and the features are meant to be under the Talking Points bullet point (even though in retrospect it of course makes sense).

Also, from now on, while the meetings can be up to 2 hours (I don't recommend it though), please make sure that the main points of discussion (for which you might need feedback from me) should happen in the first 45 mins, which is the maximum time for which I can be present. 

Figure out what works best for you, follow the minimal guidelines, and transform the agenda to be the backbone of your meeting, not just an assignment that you have to do because the course staff asks you to do so. *Less is More* OR *Be explicit and minutious*, whatever works for you. And if I confused you, don't hesitate to send me a message :)

#### Chair performance

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: It was a pretty good performance for the chairman, especially for the first meeting where the students were in charge, congrats! It wasn't however a _Perfect_ performance :) 

While I was present at the meeting, a majority of the topics were covered while reasonably sticking to the time estimation, which is indeed a performance! The chairman acted as a reasonable mediator, took charge of the meeting, and reminded everyone when it was time to move on. However, my single biggest point of feedback which is also not trivial to fix and yet you should try to do that, is including **everybody** in the conversation, even when not everybody wants to be included. The chairman tried to do that at the beginning of the meeting but later on 2-3 voices dominated the rest of the meeting, which is something that I do not like to see. When I said that I wanted activity from everybody, I was pretty serious about it, it is one of my main tasks as a TA to make sure that that happens, and I outsource this responsibility to the chairman in every meeting. Even though there might be varying degrees of introvertism/extrovertism among the team and multiple ways of communication (physical vs. online meetings), the process of efficientizing the meetings shouldn't happen by letting people who do not want to involve themselves as much in the meetings to just do that, and this will be the responsibility of the chairman from now on.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: Most of my constructive feedback was already presented in the previous section. Basically, I want to see activity from absolutely everyone and I will be strict about this in the next weeks. Apart from that, the team successfully took ownership of the meeting, I didn't have to intervene with any significant clarification/addition. The atmosphere felt mostly constructive and everyone was listened to and their ideas were taken into account. Make sure that in the next weeks, there are 6 main voices, not only 3 :)

Something funny that I wrote in my notes about your meeting: "- they're discussing democracy, democracy left for later". Also, don't be afraid to be unique with your Code of Conduct and please be as specific as possible, it might be very useful later, find a "system of government" in your team that works, if you go for democracy then state how ties are dealt with and specify what happens when your teammates are late to meetings and with deadlines.
