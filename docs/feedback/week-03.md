## Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker. 

## Agenda 

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: Good job with the agenda, it seems that my feedback from last week was followed :) I don't think the time estimation was pretty accurate but like I already mentioned before several times, that's completely fine especially at the beginning, it takes a while to come up with proper estimations. Short and to the point, and it was almost completely followed during the meeting. Don't forget that you can explicitly specify the questions that you might have for me if you want me to prepare to answer them. Moreover, thanks for double checking whether the Markdown was properly formatted by Gitlab! (There might be a few missing points though, but check the other feedback rubrics for this)

## Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Evaluated: Minute taker of Week 3

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: The notes are very clear and properly summarize everything that has been discussed in the meeting, while also having a proper length (not too short, not too long).  
There's a clear point of improvement, but it's more related to the actual meeting: while there are concrete agreements (which are actionable and realistic), there is no list of tasks assigned to people for the next sprint. While the previous week was mostly dedicated to exploring, you should start already dividing up tasks related to your project and have this as a point of discussion in the agenda. (LATER EDIT: I now remembered that you actually did talk about task division, and it was a good discussion, but apparently it's missing from the minutes document, please include it from now on).
Maybe consider using using bullet points.

Evaluated: Minute taker of Week 2

Mark: **Good** 

Feedback: Same comments as above.

## Chair performance

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: Awesome performance and nice job! The chair followed the agenda and reminded the team when it was the time to move on from a certain subject. The attitude was the right combination of serious and jovial and he facillitated discussions among the teammates while also not losing from sight the fact that he is still in charge of the meeting. Moreover, he tried to include everyone in the discussions and actively asked the less talkative teammates for their opinions. All topics from the agenda were covered and in a reasonable time. Good job, a blueprint for the next meetings' chairs.

## Attitude & Relation


Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: The team took ownernship of the meeting and I didn't feel the need to interfere at any point. Everyone was active and involved in the discussions to different extents and the atmosphere created was really constructive. Everyone spoke their minds and took each other's opinions into consideration. However, it's not an excellent mark because I still consider that some people should speak their mind even more. Nonetheless, it was an improvement from the last week and I hope the trend of improvement will continue :)


## Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: You haven't presented me what you worked on, but that's still understandable because the previous week was mostly for exploring. I think you could have a point in the agenda where you so a small presentation on what you have so far. Additionally, prepare beforehand for the presentation (I don't expect you to prepare it this next week, since I was more late than I wanted to be, I'll ask you directly to present me your progress so far). Maybe the chair should specify in the agenda who does the presentation. Everything that was talked about in the meeting was merged to main.


## Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team


Mark: **Good**

Feedback: From your discussions, it seemed to me that the everyone contributed somewhat equally, with some exceptions. Not everyone reached their goals but everyone was open about this and thus I'm optimistic about the next meetings. I will pay more attention to this rubric in the future weeks, since the pace of development will slowly but surely accelerate.
