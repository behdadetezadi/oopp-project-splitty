## Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker. 


## Agenda 


Mark: **Insufficient**

Feedback: The agenda was just completely bad, there's no way I can sugarcoat this. The chair didn't do his job and I also blame the team for not sending reminders to the chair about utter state of the agenda. It's still called "week-04.md(DRAFT)". It's not formatted correctly (you need to put an empty line between the table and the topics), there're section with (?) for time estimation, it contains statements such as "Does not apply", it has nothing personalized with the needs of this week's specific agenda (I will check for my own curiosity whether it has anything different than the template agenda). With such a bad agenda, the flow of the meeting was naturally impacted. It was my 4th meeting with you folks and I know for a fact that you can do way better than this. I hope you will improve for the remainder of the project, I am certain that you can. You just have to care, and not about the course or the grades, but caring about doing things correctly.


## Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

> I accidentaly already gave you feedback for this in the previous week, I'll copy it here

> Minutes Week3:

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: Good job with the agenda, it seems that my feedback from last week was followed :) I don't think the time estimation was pretty accurate but like I already mentioned before several times, that's completely fine especially at the beginning, it takes a while to come up with proper estimations. Short and to the point, and it was almost completely followed during the meeting. Don't forget that you can explicitly specify the questions that you might have for me if you want me to prepare to answer them. Moreover, thanks for double checking whether the Markdown was properly formatted by Gitlab! (There might be a few missing points though, but check the other feedback rubrics for this)


## Chair performance


Mark: **Insufficient/Sufficient**

Feedback: I think the chair tried to do a good job, but with a bad agenda, that was impossible. I will recommend to all of the future chairs to take a look over the document that explains how should you do your job. 
- The chair should ignore me (the TA) when holding the meeting, unless directly asking me questions or for my opinions or when referencing me. No need to look at me for approval. Don't be afraid to be confidenct!
- The chair didn't need knew when to move on from certain subjects because there were no time estimates
- The chair didn't impose himself and made his voice heard enough, and didn't encourage the rest of the teammates to speak up and actively encourage to do so, so once again, some the distribution of talking was quite unequal
- Meeting was over very early, this usually means that the team has been extremely efficient with their time organization and covered everything that they wanted to cover OR the team lacked any organization of topic discussion. In my opinion, the second scenario is more likely.

## Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: I like the athmosphere in your team! I don't think it shined in this meeting, but constructive talks were again present during this meeting. The talks were open and people weren't afraid to ask me and talk about controversial topics (is accessibility importand xD, don't worry I won't judge, I'm happy that the discussions are genuine, I can actually help you more in this way). Once again, I've noticed the trend in which half of the team is more involved in the meeting than the other half. But when the more silent half spoke up, their opinions to were listend to and taken into account. The general mood of the meeting was a bit more "tired" than in other meetings, that's why I'm giving you a mark of *good* instead of *very good*.

## Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: You showed me what you have achieved so far. You focused on creating a nice frontend, which, while commendable, worries me a little. Considering your coding experience, I would strongly recommend you to work on a feature level rather than working on frontend / backend separately. Nonetheless, I have trust in you and I can't wait to see what you achieved next week, I'm optimistic about your team (but I want to please see functionality on the backend). The presented changes were on main and there was considerable progress compared to last week. I'd say that you are on track! Also keep exploring the fun easter eggs, but DO NOT sacrifice time that would have went in actual OOPP work.


## Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback: The action list from last week was not really covered and I'm unsure whether you all reached your goals. I blame this mostly on the poor meeting organization. I no longer have the feeling that contributions are equal and I will investigate this a bit further. You should strive towards a relatively equal contributions (or at least I do not want to see negative outliers).
