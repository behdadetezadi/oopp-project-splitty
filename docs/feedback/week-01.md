# Feedback Week 1

I finalized the formative feedback for the first week. For now, it mostly consists of trivial aspects (since we only had one single meeting so far) so that you can become accustomed to the current feedback process. 


## 1) Self-organization

Grade: **Good**

Since this was the first meeting, I was mostly in charge of the meeting, which is fine only for the first meeting. Thus, I appreciated that everybody tried to participate to the meeting, with a friendly and respectful tone. We established most of the rules and channels of communication. Agenda was non-existent, which is again fine in the first week but is expected in the following weeks. While everyone was involved in the meeting, the degree of activity varied. One thing that could be done for next weeks is for individual members to involve people that they observe to be not involved. 
In the following weeks, make sure that every voice is heared, every opinion is expressed and try to accomodate everyone's needs regarding opinions, choices, schedules and so on (and while you will probably do things democratically in your project, beware of the classical issue of the tiranny of the majority). Not a lot more to say on this topic for now. 


## 2) Suggested Topics

Grade: **N/A**

A bit hard to grade this for now. For next meeting the chair should have a list of topics to talk about so that nothing goes overlooked. All questions that will need an answer from the TA should be sent at least one day before the meeting (so that would be Monday night).
