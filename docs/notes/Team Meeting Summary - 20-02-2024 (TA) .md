## Introduction

We agree that in this meeting we would like to focus on reviewing the draft of our code of conduct and on distributing tasks for the development portion of the project. It's worth noting that most members have either completed or started their individual Git assignments, and everyone has successfully run the template project on their local machines.

## TA Comments

Our TA emphasizes the importance of starting to code this week. Engaging with the project early on by experimenting and troubleshooting is beneficial. It is also mentioned that each feature should be developed on its own branch and merged into the main branch upon completion. Out TA also advises that our documentation does not need to be overly formal and that our code of conduct should be clear and simple to follow.

## Code of Conduct

There are mixed opinions on the use of democratic processes for decision-making within the project. Concerns are raised about situations where the majority vote might conflict with a strong opinion of an individual. We decided to hold an additional meetings outside of this meeting to address this and how we will move forward with decision making within our team.

The current draft of our conflict resolution protocol is too formal. We agree that a more straightforward approach to conflict resolution is needed, even for minor disputes. We agreed that the consequences for infractions should be a warning for the first offense, providing snacks for the team on the second, and a more serious discussion for the third.

We also see the need for more specificity in our goals and expectations for the project's grade, as it stands it is too vaguely stated. We also decide to switch our primary meetings communication channel to Discord for more efficient collaboration.

## Project Preferences

Nobody had any specific preferences regarding working on particular parts of the project. We do agree on using a feature-oriented approach, which will allow us to gain experience with both frontend and backend development, using JavaFX and Spring frameworks at the same time.

While direct code collaboration (pair programming) is prohibited, team members can work sequentially on feature implementation.
