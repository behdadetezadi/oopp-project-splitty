## Introduction

- In our online meeting we updated each other on our progress and we discussed the things we still need to complete in order to reach the basic requirements and rubric points. 
- We also talked about how we are going to do the tests for JavaFX and we discussed the possible extensions we could do in the future. We came to the conclusion that live language switch, the statistics, and email notification are doable options, but we will first focus on finishing up the basic requirements. 
- Everyone was present.

## Action Points 
- Our goal is to finish the basic requirements this week:
    - Behdad: work on the language switch, look into the colour switch, look at the recent events.
    - Vuk: work on the long polling and the websockets, work on the validation of the participant (validate input).
    - Jodie: show the overview of all the expenses, fix the overview of the participant expenses.
    - Lotte: work on deleting and editing the expense.
    - Tijn: work on keyboard shortcuts and navigation without a mouse, change the size and boldness of the text so it is more accessible.
    - Maks: finish up the admin page and login, make the slides for the product pitch.

- On Saturday we will check in with each other on WhatsApp to give an update about our progress. Based on that, the people who are finished on their tasks can help others or work on:
    - Testing everything
    - Multiple clients connecting to one server
    - Accessibility
