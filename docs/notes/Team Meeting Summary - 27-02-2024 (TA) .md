## Introduction

- In the initial part of the meeting it was checked if everyone is on track and more specifically it was checked if everyone has done the Git assigment. Afterward the remaining unmerged MRs were discussed on the matter of why they are not being merged which almost the only answer was the pipeline fails and inconsistencies which the team decided to resolve after this meeting in an additional session in the afternoon.


## TA Comments

- During the Q&A some key points were mentioned such as the conditions for weekly commits and MRs are checked automatically. Also, it was mentioned that there is no chance after you fail to repair an assignment. (such as Git)
- Also, it was advised that we shouldn't divide responsibility based on front-end and back-end and should have a feature-based approach.
- One question that was stated was about the usage of JFX Web package to which the answer was "In some cases yes as long as it does not make JFX trivial"


## Code of Conduct
- Not everyone had completed their assigned code of conduct section, so it was decided that by thursday everybody should have done their part of code of conduct and everybody should have read it before the meeting so that we can finalize it on the meeting on Thursday.
## Checkstyle
- The team started discussing the Checkstyle rules to agree on and some rules were mentioned such as Cyclomatic Complexity of 10 to avoid nested ifs and loops (It was decided that the final number would be rediscussed next week)
- Next week the TA will announce if the Checkstyle rules should be included in the code of conduct or not.
- It was discussed that JavaDoc is also an essential rule but not getters and setter. (other trivial methods might also be added to exclusions in the future)
- The team is set to check whether they should put naming conventions in their Checkstyle rules.
- On Thursday meeting the team is set to discuss the maximum method line allowed. (75-100 was suggested by team members)
- To sum up finalization and serious discussion of Checkstyle was moved to thursday.
## Merge Request Handling
- It was agreed upon that for each merge request to be ready to merge at least two people should approve it, and it is recommended to have three people approve it.
- No MRs should be left unattended for more than two days.
- It was also officially encouraged that the people who share a similar responsibility or are working on closely related features should approve of each-others MRs.
- From now on important and highly impactful MRs will have teammates directly assigned for review.
## Miscellaneous Points
- It was stated that the implementation of the basic features does not have a separate deadline.
- The team planned to look for insightful and informative JFX tutorials and share them through WhatsApp/Discord.
- During this meeting it was set that everyone has to try to refine their previous code make sure it works and is useful.
- Also, it was set that after thursdays meeting the team should start working on API endpoints and by thursday everyone has to be fully familiarized with the projects process.
