## Introduction

in this week's online meeting we talked mainly about the problem we face with postman, and checking if everyone finish the basic scenes build, also decided to fix the scences controller this week and start to implement the features by the end of next week 

## Postman fixing and scenes builder connection

In testing our backend with Postman, we found managing POST requests challenging due to complex constructors. We're now simplifying these constructors and refactoring our code for realism and practicality.

Additionally, following the basic setup, our main focus for this and the upcoming week is to refine the scenes controller, and establish connections between the backend and frontend. By the end of next week, we plan to begin assigning work and implementing features.
