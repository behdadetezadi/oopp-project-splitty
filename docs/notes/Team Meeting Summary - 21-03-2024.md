## Introduction

- In this week's online meeting, we discussed how we were all able to connect the scenes together with more functionality and are actually making progress with connecting to the backend.
- Tijn never showed up, so according to our Code of Conduct, we issue him a formal warning as a first offense. 
- We reiterated the importance of having some functioning product by Tuesday.

## Main Action Points 
- In general we are working towards crossing off as many basic requirements as possible before the next TA meeting.
- The work distrbution is as follows (but is subject to minor changes later on):
    - Behdad: Connect the frontend and backend fully through "Event" tab and try to finalize that section of our application.
    - Vuk: Connect the frontend and backend fully through "Participant" tab and try to finalize that section of our application.
    - Jodie and Lotte: Connect the frontend and backend fully through "Expense" tab and try to finalize that section of our application.
    - Tijn:  Connect the frontend and backend fully through "Event" tab and try to finalize that section of our application.
    - Maks: Create admin scenes and think about the functionality that should be associated with them.

- Whoever is done quickly is also free to research about a few more topics such as:
    - Websocket Connections and long polling
    - Changing css files and adding keyboard shortcuts through a config file
    - Doing scene switching in main controllers
    - Adding keyboard shortcuts
